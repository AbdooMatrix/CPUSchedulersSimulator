# CPU Schedulers Simulator

This project simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms. It is designed to help understand how various scheduling methods manage processes, such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin, etc. The simulation helps visualize process management in operating systems.

### Features:
- Simulation of multiple CPU scheduling algorithms
- Process queue management
- Time-based execution simulation

### Technologies:
- Java

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
3. Run the simulation: `java -jar CPUSchedulerSimulator.jar`
